\begin{itemize}
	\item In 2022, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected four algorithms for its post-quantum cryptography standardization process.
	\pause

	\item In theory, these algorithms can base their security on problems that are considered still hard given large-scale quantum computing.
	\pause

	\item In practice, the implementations of these algorithms need side-channel countermeasures.
	\pause

	\item There exist attacks on \textsc{Falcon} that have not been addressed (until our paper).
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Notation}

Throughout the presentation, we assume
\pause
\begin{itemize}
%    \item $M > N$ are two positive integers and $N = 2^\kappa$ for some integer $\kappa$.
%    \pause
%    \item $\phi = x^N + 1$ is a polynomial.
%    \pause
%    \item $q$ is a prime number.
%    \pause
%    \item Represent a vector $\mathbf{v}$ by a boldface letter, and a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ by a boldface capital letter.
%    \item For a polynomial $f \in \Z[x] / \phi$, it can be considered as an $N$-by-$N$ matrix.
    \item For a variable $x$, the $j$th bit of $x$ is written as $x^{(j)}$.
    \pause
    \item The $i$th bit to $j$th bit ($j \geq i$) of $x$ is represented by $x^{[j:i]}$.
    \pause
    \item A sequence of $n$ variables $(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ (e.g. shares of variable $x$) is written as $(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$, or simply $(x_i)$.
    \pause
    \item For a proposition $P$, $\llbracket P \rrbracket = 1$ if and only if $P$ is true and $0$ if otherwise.
