\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item To defend against the potential threat from large-scale quantum computers, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a standardization process for post-quantum cryptography in 2016.
    \pause
    \item In 2022, \textsc{Falcon} \cite{NISTPQC-R3:FALCON20} became one of the selected schemes that were expected to be part of NIST's post-quantum cryptographic standards.
    \pause
    \item  In theory, these algorithms can base their security on problems that are considered still hard given the advantage of quantum computing.
    \pause
    \item In practice, the implementations of these algorithms can suffer side-channel attacks.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Our Contributions}

In this paper, we present the following contributions:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose the first masking scheme on the floating-point number multiplication and addition in the pre-image vector computation of \textsc{Falcon} as a countermeasure.
    \pause
    \item We verify theoretical security in the probing model \cite{C:IshSahWag03} and practical leakage via the Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) \cite{gilbert2011testing}.
    \pause
    \item We also test the performance by comparing with the reference implementation of \textsc{Falcon} \cite{NISTPQC-R3:FALCON20}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Notation}

We assume
\pause
\begin{itemize}
%    \item $M > N$ are two positive integers and $N = 2^\kappa$ for some integer $\kappa$.
%    \pause
%    \item $\phi = x^N + 1$ is a polynomial.
%    \pause
%    \item $q$ is a prime number.
%    \pause
%    \item Represent a vector $\mathbf{v}$ by a boldface letter, and a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ by a boldface capital letter.
%    \item For a polynomial $f \in \Z[x] / \phi$, it can be considered as an $N$-by-$N$ matrix.
    \item For a variable $x$, the $j$th bit of $x$ is written as $x^{(j)}$.
    \pause
    \item The $i$th bit to $j$th bit ($j \geq i$) of $x$ is represented by $x^{[j:i]}$.
    \pause
    \item A sequence of $n$ variables $(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ (e.g. shares of variable $x$) is written as $(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$, or simply $(x_i)$.
    \pause
    \item For a proposition $P$, $\llbracket P \rrbracket = 1$ if and only if $P$ is true and $0$ if otherwise.
\end{itemize}
