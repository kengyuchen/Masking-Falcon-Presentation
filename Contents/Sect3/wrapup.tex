\begin{frame}{Wrapping-up}

Utilizing {\sf SecNonzero}, {\sf SecFprUrsh}, and {\sf SecFprNorm64}, we design the following gadgets:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\sf SecFPR}: Secure FPR (FPN packing and rounding) by masking.
	\pause
	\item {\sf SecFprMul}: Secure FprMul (FPN multiplication) by masking.
	\pause
	\item {\sf SecFprAdd}: Secure FprAdd (FPN addition) by masking.
\end{itemize}
\pause
We leave the details of the implementations and several tricks for improvements in our paper.
