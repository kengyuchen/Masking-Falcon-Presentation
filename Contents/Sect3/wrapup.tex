\begin{frame}{Wrapping-up}

Utilizing new gadgets and the tricks, we design the following gadgets:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\sf SecFPR}: Secure FPR by masking.
	\pause
	\item {\sf SecFprMul}: Secure FprMul by masking.
	\pause
	\item {\sf SecFprAdd}: Secure FprAdd by masking.
\end{itemize}
\pause
\medskip

We leave the details of concrete implementations and several tricks for improvements in \hyperlink{sec:appendix-gadgets-design}{\color{blue} Appendix â€“ Details of Our Design}.
