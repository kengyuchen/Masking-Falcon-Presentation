\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

In this paper,
\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item We present the first masking algorithm for floating-point number multiplication and addition to protect the pre-image vector computation.
	\pause
	\item We design novel gadgets {\sf SecNonzero}, {\sf SecFprUrsh}, and {\sf SecFprNorm64} to mask the algorithms.
	\pause
	\item All our masked algorithms are proven $t$-NI or $t$-SNI secure â€“ they are $t$-probing secure.
	\pause
	\item The TVLA result shows no leakage in the 2-shared version in 10,000 traces, and no leakage in the 3-shared version in 100,000 traces.
	\pause
	\item Our countermeasure when compared to the unmasked reference implementation is much slower. Improved {\sf SecAdd} and {\sf A2B} can reduce the cost.
\end{itemize}
