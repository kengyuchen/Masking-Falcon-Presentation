\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

In this paper,
\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item We present the first masking scheme for floating-point number multiplication and addition to protect the pre-image vector computation of \textsc{Falcon}.
	\pause
	\item We design novel gadgets {\sf SecNonzero}, {\sf SecFprUrsh}, and {\sf SecFprNorm64}.
	\pause
	\item All our masked gadgets are proven either $t$-NI or $t$-SNI secure.
	\pause
	\item Our design pass the TVLA test in 10,000 (for 2-shared) or 100,000 (for 3-shared) traces.
	\pause
	\item Our countermeasure when compared to the unmasked reference implementation is much slower. Improved {\sf SecAdd} and {\sf A2B} can reduce the cost.
\end{itemize}
